## upcoming

- CI tweaks
- created changelog (hopefully will be kept updated??)
- change soon text for "New Project" button from "Coming Soon&trade;" to "Soon&trade;", makes it fit in one line

## v0.0.0-rolling.1

this was a test release, for setting up automated releases. App doesn't work quite yet :p

- `lib`'s very basic and essential functionality is complete (but should still be considered alpha, needs more testing)
- added welcome screen, allow to open multiwindow / multiproject functionality
  - recents page is a hardcoded bunch of random paths
  - the window that opens when you open a project does absolutely nothing but display text that was used as a scrolling test
- no dark mode support yet h
