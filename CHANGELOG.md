# changelog

## upcoming

- correct version will now reflect in the app
- created changelog (hopefully will be kept updated??)
- change soon text for "New Project" button from "Coming Soon&trade;" to "Soon&trade;", makes it fit in one line
- add documentation, changelog, about buttons to welcome
- change title / tagline font on welcome screen to permanent marker

## v0.0.0-rolling.1

this was a test release, for setting up automated releases. App doesn't work quite yet :p

- `lib`'s very basic and essential functionality is complete, meaning that the essential advertised features should be working once hooked up to the frontend! (but should still be considered alpha, needs more testing)
- added welcome screen, allow to open multiwindow / multiproject functionality
  - recents page is a hardcoded bunch of random paths
  - the window that opens when you open a project does absolutely nothing but display text that was used as a scrolling test
- no dark mode support yet h
