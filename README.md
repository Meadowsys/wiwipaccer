# wiwipaccer, aka, Pack Builder&trade; <!-- omit from toc -->

The Pack Builder&trade; is a desktop app, allowing users to deeply customise their resource packs and build custom resource packs for any version of the game that supports them. To allow this, we provide a new format for resource pack "sources". This format allows pack authors to encapsulate textures (or however grouping is desired) into their own directories, as well as have variants for textures, and versions for different resource pack versions / game versions side by side, making it easier to both maintain and customise resource packs, for both pack authors and end users.

## Why is this repo empty?

I decided (yet again) a clean start would be nice, so uh, pardon the delay while i get things sorted.

Soon&trade;
