# wiwipaccer, aka, Pack Builder&trade; <!-- omit from toc -->

The Pack Builder&trade; is a desktop app that provides the ability to create a highly customised resource pack, offering extremely fine grained options, including the ability to choose what to include, on a level as fine as per-texture (depending on what pack authors choose to support). It does this by providing a new format for resource pack "source code", which seperates out textures into their own directories. It also allows pack developers to maintain different variations of the same texture, as well as for different minecraft versions, side by side, which allows one to build a resource pack for any pack version / minecraft version that supports resource packs, provided the pack authors provide the "source code" for the right versions.

## Why is this repo empty?

I decided (yet again) a clean start would be nice, so uh, pardon the delay while i get things sorted.
