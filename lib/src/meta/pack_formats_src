// src of file `pack_formats` (in the same dir). To build, run `pnpm gen-versions`

// lines starting with two slashes will have the _entire line_ treated as a comment

// Script will take the latest version with data, propogate it to later versions with maybe, so
// that there is at least _some_ data before it gets verified

// format: <mc version string> <pack version number> <descriptor>
// mc version string: version, as returned by mojang's API, spaces and all, no quotes
//    mojang api: https://launchermeta.mojang.com/mc/game/version_manifest.json
// pack version number: integer, the pack format
//    use for verified, unverified, or maybe
//    omit for unknown, none
// descriptor is one of verified, unverified, maybe, unknown, none
//    verified: manually checked
//    unverified: data yoinked from wiki
//    maybe: educated guesses based on other factors (versions of versions released before/after),
//       and like data that the wiki doesn't provide
//    unknown: version exists but is not known (default)
//    none: versioning does not exist for this mc version

// Ordering in this file does not matter.
